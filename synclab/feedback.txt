1. Not as long as we thought we would. The Python syntax was weird for Chuck to start, but we fixed
   this thing up in a couple hours accidentally.
   (Chuck's edit: I wasn't satisfied with the syntax because it felt too easy, and didn't require us
    to use what we learned in class. Here's a better submission)

2. It was alright, I guess.

3. What's a learning community?
