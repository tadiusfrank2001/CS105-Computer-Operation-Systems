# CS105: Computer Systems

This course provides a programmerâ€™s view of how computer systems execute programs, store information, and
communicate. It enables students to become more effective programmers, especially in dealing with issues of
performance, portability, and robustness. It also serves as a foundation for courses on compilers, networks,
operating systems, security, and computer architecture, where a deeper understanding of systems-level issues
is required. Topics covered include: data representations, computer arithmetic, machine-level code and its
generation, performance evaluation and optimization, memory organization and management, processes and
concurrent computation, and networking technology and protocols.
