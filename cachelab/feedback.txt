1. We worked on different solutions separately before we decided that mine was
better, so Russell helped clean up bugs I somehow never saw when I was
debugging. Implementation took me about 3 hours, debugging took like 10. No, I
am not counting the late days because I didn't even have the know-how about this
assignment!
